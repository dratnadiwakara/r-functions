# Motivation for a Performance Benchmark Model

The performance benchmark model provides a quantitative framework for assessing the future vulnerability and performance of firms. By analyzing key firm-level quantitative metrics, this model makes informed predictions about firms' future performance based on current data. The underlying assumption is that past and current financial indicators contain valuable information that, when systematically analyzed, can forecast future conditions and potential vulnerabilities.

The model operates in three key steps:

1. **Prediction of Future Performance Metrics**: The model uses current-period quantitative data to predict various performance metrics relevant to assessing firm vulnerability. These metrics could include profitability, leverage ratios, and liquidity indicators. By leveraging historical data and relationships, the model forecasts how firms are likely to perform, providing early warnings of potential financial distress.

2. **Aggregation of Metrics into a Composite Rating**: Once individual future performance metrics are predicted, the model aggregates them into a composite rating for each firm. This simplifies analysis by consolidating multiple performance indicators into a single metric representing the firm's overall performance and vulnerability.

3. **Comparison to Existing Ratings**: The composite rating for each firm is then grouped into categories that follow the distribution of pre-existing rating systems, classifying firms into tiers based on their predicted vulnerability. These categories provide a clear, standardized way to assess firms' financial health.

The value of this approach lies in its ability to offer an objective, data-driven assessment of firms' future performance. This model serves as a valuable tool for identifying firms that may need closer supervision or intervention.

# Estimation Sample

The estimation sample consists of firms that meet a specific set of criteria, referred to as Criteria A. The time period used for the estimation spans from the second quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2024, chosen due to the availability of complete data for all variables included in the model.

# Model Specification

The performance benchmark model captures the relationship between current firm-level quantitative measures and future performance using a regression-based approach. This section outlines the key components of the model.

The model is based on **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression**, which estimates the relationship between a set of independent variables (right-hand-side or **rhs variables**) and dependent variables (left-hand-side or **lhs variables**). The dependent variables represent different aspects of firm performance, such as profitability, leverage, or liquidity. These metrics are key indicators of a firm's future financial health and vulnerability.

### Key Elements of the Model

1. **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**: OLS is chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in identifying linear relationships between the independent variables and future firm performance metrics.

2. **Quarter-Fixed Effects**: The model incorporates **quarter-fixed effects** to account for time-related factors that affect all firms in a particular quarter, such as macroeconomic conditions or regulatory changes. These fixed effects control for time-dependent shocks, allowing the model to focus on firm-specific factors.

### Dependent Variables (lhs variables)

The dependent variables represent future performance measures and are predicted based on the independent variables from the current quarter. The table below lists the lhs variables used in the model and their definitions.

### Independent Variables (rhs variables)

The independent variables consist of firm-level quantitative measures available at the current time period. These predictors are used to forecast the performance of firms in the future. The table below lists the rhs variables used in the model and their definitions.

# Summary Statistics

The summary statistics provide an overview of the key characteristics of the dependent and independent variables used in the model. These statistics include distribution, central tendencies, and variability.

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize the mean, median, standard deviation, and range for both the lhs and rhs variables. The table below reports these statistics for the entire sample of firms with complete observations.

### Sample Size by Quarter

The figure below plots the sample size of firms with complete observations in each quarter from the second quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2024.

# Model Estimation

The estimation process involves fitting regression models for each lhs variable using rhs variables as predictors. The objective is to generate predicted values for each future performance metric based on current data.

### Fitting the Models

Each lhs variable is regressed on the rhs variables using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression**. **Quarter-fixed effects** are included to control for unobserved factors affecting all firms in a given quarter, such as macroeconomic shocks or regulatory changes.

### Calculating Predicted Values

After estimating the model, the next step is to calculate predicted values for each lhs variable. The **quarter-fixed effects** are not applied directly to the predictions. Instead, the mean of all quarter-fixed effects is calculated and added to the predicted values. This normalization ensures consistency across periods and prevents distortions from specific quarters' fixed effects.

### Regression Results

The regression results for each lhs variable are summarized in a results table. The table includes:
- **Coefficient estimates**: Indicating the direction and magnitude of the relationship between each rhs variable and the corresponding lhs variable.
- **Standard errors**: Indicating the uncertainty around each estimate.

It is important to note that the **coefficient estimates for quarter-fixed effects** are not displayed.

# Model Prediction

Once the models are estimated, they are used to generate predictions for each firm’s future performance. These predicted values form the foundation for the rating estimation process.

### Observed vs. Predicted Values

The figure below compares the observed values and the predicted values for each lhs variable. A good model will show predicted values closely tracking the observed outcomes over time.

### Validation of Predicted Values

To validate the model’s accuracy, each observed lhs variable is regressed on its corresponding predicted value. The closer the coefficient of the predicted variable is to 1, and the higher the R-squared, the better the model performs at forecasting future outcomes.

### Out-of-Sample Predictions

After validation, the model generates out-of-sample predictions using the most recent quarter for which rhs data is available. These predictions provide a forward-looking assessment of firms' future performance and form the basis for the rating estimation.

# Rating Estimation

The final step is the estimation of performance ratings, which quantify firm vulnerability based on predicted future performance metrics. These ratings are calculated as percentile rankings, then assigned to specific rating categories.

### Rating Percentiles

For each lhs variable, three versions of ratings are calculated based on the predicted values:

#### 1. Cumulative Distribution Rating (CDF Rating)

Each firm’s predicted performance is compared to the historical distribution of the same variable using the **cumulative distribution function (CDF)**. The percentile rank is expressed as **1 - Percentile**, with lower values indicating better performance. This rating is denoted as `lhs1_cdf`, `lhs2_cdf`, etc.

#### 2. T-Distribution Rating

This method assumes the predicted values follow a **t-distribution** based on historical data. As with the CDF rating, the percentile rank is expressed as **1 - Percentile**. This rating is denoted as `lhs1_t`, `lhs2_t`, etc.

#### 3. Rank-Based Rating

All firms are ranked by their predicted values, and the ranks are expressed as percentages of the total number of firms. This ranking-based measure is also reversed, so lower values indicate better performance. This rating is denoted as `lhs1_rank`, `lhs2_rank`, etc.

### Combining Ratings into Composite Scores

Two composite ratings are calculated for each firm: a **historical composite rating** and a **fitted composite rating**.

#### 1. Historical Composite Rating

The historical rating for each lhs variable is the mean of the CDF rating and the rank-based rating. The historical ratings for all lhs variables are then averaged to create a **composite historical rating** for each firm.

#### 2. Fitted Composite Rating

The fitted rating for each lhs variable is the mean of the t-distribution rating and the rank-based rating. The fitted ratings for all lhs variables are then averaged to create a **composite fitted rating** for each firm.

### Rating Categories

Each firm is assigned to a rating category based on the distribution of composite ratings. The categories are as follows:
- **A**: Top 50% of firms (least vulnerable).
- **B**: Next 30% (moderate vulnerability).
- **C**: Next 10% (higher vulnerability).
- **D**: Bottom 10% (most vulnerable).

The figures below display the estimated composite historical and fitted ratings for each firm based on the most recent data.
